The samples in this portfolio are a tiny sample of the thousands of documents on which I've worked.

The **Editing** sample is the most recent work here, and shows how I improve another writer's content. This installation guide to a Big Data product is written for an audience of IT professionals. This document required a heavy edit, and there are many queries to the author. You'll find it easiest to view the changes and comments if you display the Comments pane in Adobe Acrobat. They address issues of clarity, tone, concision, translatability, style, and (of course) syntax.

I wrote the **Facebook Guide** when a marketing communications agency hired me to create an administrator's guide to a custom Facebook application for hospital administration staff. The sample shows how I explain concepts clearly to those who are completely unfamiliar with the subject. (At the time of writing, you still had to assume that some people knew little about Facebook!) Although this document is for a non-technical audience, I used the same techniques that I use with technically proficient readers: assume that your audience is intelligent but lacks knowledge, and explain what the reader needs to know in the fewest, clearest words possible. The document uses a mix of task-based and feature-based information. The formatting and layout are also my own (not that they're all that great!).

By contrast, the **Knowledge Base** article demonstrates my presentation of very technical content in an environment with strict style rules. In this article, there is no room for an individual author's voice. There is a great deal of procedural content and fairly complex terminology.

The **Site Guide** is the draft of a user's guide to a newly developed SharePoint site. It's midway in complexity between the Facebook guide and the Knowledge Base article. The template is the client's, but the content is my own.

Finally, I've included the **Style Guide** for a large manufacturing company, which I created to fill a need for a concise reference to house style. Not all of the guidelines are my own, but the general presentation and its organization are. Every organization that produces external content needs a style guide, and I've authored or maintained one for more than one company.
