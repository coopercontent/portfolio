The samples in this portfolio are a tiny sample of the thousands of documents that I've worked on in my career. 

The **Writing** sample was written in 2010, when a marketing communications agency hired me to write an administrator's guide to a custom Facebook application for hospital administration staff. The sample shows how I explain concepts clearly to those who are completely unfamiliar with the subject. (At the time, you still had to assume that some people knew little about Facebook!) Although this document is for a non-technical audience, I used the same techniques that I use with technically proficient readers: assume that your audience is intelligent but lacks knowledge, and explain what the reader needs to know in the fewest, clearest words possible. The document uses a mix of task-based and feature-based information. The formatting and layout are also my own (not that they're all that great!).

The **Editing** sample is recent work that shows how I go about improving existing content. This content is highly technical. You'll find it easiest to view the changes and comments if you display the Comments pane in Adobe Acrobat: this document required a heavy edit, and there are many queries to the author. They address issues of clarity, tone, concision, translatability, style, and (of course) syntax.

NOTE: These documents remain the property of the organizations who paid for them, and are not to be distributed. Please use them only to learn about my way of working.
